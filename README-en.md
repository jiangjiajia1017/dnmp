## 3.Multiple php version
Default, we create 3 php container, they are PHP7.2, PHP5.6 and PHP5.4,

We can change easy by modify Nginx configuration `fastcgi_pass`.

For example, [http://localhost](http://localhost) use PHP5.4, Nginx `fastcgi_pass` is:
```
    fastcgi_pass   php54:9000;
```
To use PHP7.2, change it:
```
    fastcgi_pass   php72:9000;
```
Then reload nginx:
```bash
$ docker exec -it dnmp_nginx_1 nginx -s reload
```
Done.
